# Description

Have you ever wanted to go for a run or take a walk, but had no idea what the weather looked like? What was your first course of action? Probably went to your Weather App, then had to access your Running App moments later.

Is that really so bad? ... no ...

But, wouldn't it be nicer to have one app that could do it all?

Welcome to Trekspert!

# Getting Started
## Instructions
1. Create an Account / Sign In
2. Feel free to check the weather right from the home page!
    * You can also see your best pace right below the weather section
3. Add runs and track your progress
    * Made a mistake? No sweat, you can edit and delete runs as you go
4. Track your past runs
5. If needed, a timer has been provided for your workouts!
    * You can access it at the bottom of the home page
6. Finally, we hope you enjoy the app!

# Common Questions

## Will my pace update as I update a run?

Yes, it will! No need to delete a run if you made a mistake. Feel free to edit your run and the app will handle the rest.

## How are my past runs stored? Are they in pace or date order?

Your past runs will be stored in date order. Your most recent runs populate at the top and, while you can see the pace of each run, it does not impact the sorting at this time.
